# BreastCancerPrediction
It's Predicts the probability of a person having the chances of breast Cancer by analysing their medical conditions.
The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository
1. Identifying the problem  and Data Sources
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Pre-Processing the Data
4. Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is  malignant or Benign

In our project, the predictive analysis of the machine learning algorithms is achieved. The machine learning algorithms applied in our project are:
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classifier that divides the datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH) via the nearest data points.
•	Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble method for classification, regression, and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set
•	k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a supervised classification algorithm. It takes a bunch of labeled points and uses them to learn how to label other points. To label a new point, it looks at the labeled points closest to that new point, which is its nearest neighbors, and has those neighbors vote.
 •	Logistic regression is a very powerful modeling tool, is a generalization of linear regression. Logistic Regression is used to assess the likelihood of a disease or health condition as a function of a risk factor (and covariates). Both simple and multiple logistic regression , assess the association between independent variable(s) (Xi) -- sometimes called exposure or predictor variables — and a dichotomous dependent variable (Y) -- sometimes called the outcome or response variable. It is used primarily for predicting binary or multiclass dependent variables.
•	Decision Tree C4.5 is a predictive modeling tool that can be applied across many areas. It can be constructed by an algorithmic approach that can split the dataset in different ways based on different conditions
